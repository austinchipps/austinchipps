## About Me
I'm a PhD student in Jake Esselstyn's lab at Louisiana State University. Before arriving at LSU, I had received my MSc from TCU studying the population genetics of south Texas bats. I'm interested in understanding how evolution has resulted in high small mammal species richness in tropical ecosystems.
